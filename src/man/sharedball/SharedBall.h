/**
 *
 * A module that creates a global ball position. How it works:
 *
 * We go through each robot to count the number of robots (including itself)
 * that agree with its ball estimate, i.e. who have a ball estimate within
 * a "CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD" distance away.  This tells us how many robots would
 * be a part of its sharedball.  If there is a clear robot that has more robots
 * that agree with it, we say this robot is correct and calculate the shared
 * ball with it, and any robot that agrees with it.
 *
 * If there is a tie: i.e. there are two or more groups of robots that have
 * have the same number of agreements, then we use the goalie to break the
 * tie! If the goalie is part of one of these agreements, then we say the
 * goalie is right and calculate the shared ball with all robots that agree
 * with the goalie.
 *
 * To caluclate the shared ball, we take a weighted average of all robots
 * involved, depending on distance away from the ball.
 *
 * After the shared ball is calculated, if one of the robots that didn't agree
 * has a ball estimate that would agree if he were flipped... we flip that
 * robot. (As long as he is not the goalie)
 *
 * The module returns 2 messages:
 *     SharedBallMessage -> Gives coordinates of shared ball, if ball is on, and
 *                          a reliability.  The reliability is on a scale from
 *                          0 - 6, where each robot who sees the ball counts as
 *                          1, except for the goalie who counts for 2.
 *     Flip Message ------> Gives a timestamp that is used to tell if a flip
 *                          should occur at all, and a reset x, y, h.
 *                          While using the shared ball tool, the uncert is set
 *                          to which player we want to flip.
 *
 * NOTE: To test this module with the shared ball tool ("SharedViewer"),
 *       uncomment the lines in .cpp that are specified by the comments "TOOL".
